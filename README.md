rules, which contains with some data classes Use cases: Taken care of flow of data from and to
entities Controller/Presenter: Taking up the data and converting to convenient wa for UI UI: Take
care of showing the content to user Domain consists of business logic which contains server data

Retrofit is a type safe http client used to getting data from server, it calling to server by using
java interface with many request methods and request params. Okhttp used for network call. RxJava is
another library added in this to get asynchronous call. This is working based on observer and
observable concept. Now a days RxJava is more important as this is having good feature like able to
perform network call, perform synchronous and asynchronous call, performing background listening.
